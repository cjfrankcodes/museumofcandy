Candy Museum Landing Page

This project was based on a project given to me in my Udemy Course. The front page was a code along video from my Udemy course. The about and ticket pages were done entirely on my own. I put a lot of work into this project and I am very proud of the progress that I have made so far in my Udemy course. This website features a ticket page that stylistically matches the website with matching buttons and fonts. This page is also mobile and tablet friendly which is something that took a long time for me to learn. This site was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a very minor amount of javascript.
